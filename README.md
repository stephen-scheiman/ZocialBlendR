- Social Media Aggregator. Based on User Preferences 

# User Story 
As a user interested in diverse content from different platoforms, I want a website that can retrieve and display results from both Reddit and YouTube
so that I can conveniently explore a variety of content in one place. There are options to filter results specifically for Reddit or YouTube should the user prefer to one platform. 

# Acceptacance Criteria 
As a user:

1. When I visit the website, there should be a search bar prominently displayed on the homepage.
2. I should be able to enter a search query into the search bar.
3. After entering a search query, the website should display relevant results from both Reddit and YouTube on the same page.
4. The website should provide a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate interface.
